### Classification
* Breast Cancer Identification - [[Kaggle]](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)
* Sports Classifier - 
* [Cyclic LR](https://github.com/AKASH2907/deep_learning_practice/tree/master/keras/image_classification) - Implemented multi-class image classification using recent networks such as Xception, NAS Net and Efficient Net with random cut-out erasing data augmentation and Cyclic Learning rate. training code and evaluation code are both present.

## pytorch implementation

I'm noob in pytorch. So, just learning and implementing multiple github repo for pytorch. 

* Coursera IBM Pytorch - This folder contains my solution to Pytorch course by IBM on Coursera. It contain topics of tensor_tutorial, space-stretching, autograd, spiral_classification, regression and kernel implementations. [Assignments](https://github.com/AKASH2907/deep_learning_practice/tree/master/pytorch/Coursera-%20IBM%20PyTorch)

* Pytorch code practice - basics, linear regression, logistic regression, feedforward_nn, conv_nn, residual_network, rnn, bidirectional rnn, language models, GANs, VAEs, style transfer and image captioning.

## Note

* If the Jupyter notebook file is not loading, please load the notebook link on [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). It is the problem from Github side.
